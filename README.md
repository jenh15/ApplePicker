# Apple Picker

## Description
This is my Apple Picker project for CS382. This project is a game with the objective to pick up apples that fall from a tree with baskets. The player starts off with four baskets, but if an apple falls off the screen, the player loses a basket. In addition, there are bombs that fall from the tree, which if you pick up a bomb with the basket, the player loses a basket. Try to beat the high score! Here is the WebGL build: https://play.unity.com/en/games/7bf9c99e-bbbf-496e-8768-fe72d0d3fdb0/webgl-builds
